the Benefit of the City of London lying in Hospital
________
In Rome the civic crown adorn'd the brave
Whose sword a single citizen could save;
What weaths then Ladies shall your temples bind
Whose Charity takes in all human kind;
Who to the child unborn extend your care,
And snatch the pregnant matron from despair;
Wipe the viz drop that trembles in her eye,
And all her complicated wants supply!
Such are your pleasures! your caelestial task!
More prompt to give, than misery to ask!
Go on - the sacred ministry pursue
Angels in Form - Angels in Office too.

    Think when the mothers pangs to joy give place
And the sweet babe he's smiling in four face,
When all her anguish, all her fears are o'er,
And sickness, pain, and famine threat no more, 
What prayers for you will wing their way to Heaven,
What frailities if you have them, be forgiven!

    Each hardy son, whom your kind hand shall raise
Will to great Britain consecrate his days;
Her Arts her Commerce, her domain extend
Or force her haughty enemies to bend:

Mr.______ of ______ College, Oxford,
Who being catched in a Frolic on the 5th of Nov, at
night, had it imposed as a task to write something on
that day.
SOME twelve months ago, 
An hundred or so,
The Pope went to visit the Devil;
And as you will find,
Old Nick to a friend
Can behave himself wondrous civil.
Then strait quoth the Seer, 
What the de'el brought you here?
'Twas certain, some whimsical maggot;
Come, draw to a chair, 
Nay, prithee, sit near,
Here, sirrah, lay on t'other faggot.
You're welcome to H-ll,
I hope friends are well
At Paris, Madrid and at Rome:
I suppose honest Pope,
Since now you elope,
The Conclave will hang out the broom.
Then his Holiness cry'd,
All jesting aside,
Give the Pope and the Devil their dues;
Never fear, my old dad,
But I'll make thy heart glad,
For by Jove I do bring thee brave news.
There's a plot to beguile
An obstinate isle,
Great Britain, that Heretic Nation,
who so shyly behav'd
In hopes of being fav'd
By the help of a d-mn'd Reformation.
When the King with his son
To the Parliament's gone
To consult about old musty papers,
We'll give them a greeting,
Shall break up their meeting,
And try who can cut the best capers.
We shall never have done
If we burn one by one
Tis such a d-mn'd numerous race;
For when one is dead, 
Like the fam'd hydra's head,
Another starts up in his place.
Believe me, Old Nick,
We'll play them a trick,
A trick that shall serve for the nonce;
This day before dinner,
(Or else I'm a sinner)
We'll burn all the rascals at once.
There's powder enough
And combustible stuff
In thirty and odd trusty barrels,
Which shall blow all together,
The Lord shall know whither,
And decide at one blow all their quarrels.
But scarce was this said,
When in pop'd the head
Of an old Jesuitical wight,
Who cry'd you're mistaken,
They've all sav'd their bacon,
And Jemmy still stinks with the fright.
Then Satan was struck,
And cry'd, 'tis ill luck,
But you for your news shall be [thanked?];
So he call'd to the door,
Six Devils or more,
And they toss'd the poor dog in a blanket.

'In old Sir Robert Walpoles days
When Bribery had no harm init
St Aulspes] Independence gained
no tithe or preferment
The daily to Sr Robert said
It was not his intention
This country or his rights to call
and he despisid a Pension -

And this is Law he did maintain
unto his dying day Sir
This Independence he would keep
Whatever Courtieur say Sir.

For Cornwalt trust his Grandson avk
His Pride! His wish! His Glory!
And this lainid! Whatever tasks
God set him - I'll afase
If honour and Integrity
Give them a good foundation
He'll do the best that do he may
To verre ye and the nation
And this is Law

[The] worthies, in trust for the school or the church,
Pray hear me descant on the virtues of Birch.
Tho the Oak be the prince and the pride of the grove,
An emblem of pow'r and the favourite of Jove; 
Tho phoebus with Laurel his temples have bound,
And with chaplets of Poplar Alcides be crowned;
Tho Pallas the Olive has graced with her choice,
And old mother Cybele in Pines may rejoice;
Tho Bacchus delights in the Ivy and Vine
And Venus her garlands with Myrtle entwine;
Yet the Muses declare, after diligent search,
No tree can be found to compare with the Birch
[]Birch they aver, is the true tree of knowledge
Revered by each school, and remember'd at College,
Tho Virgils fam'd tree may produce, as its fruit
A crop of vain dreams , and strange whims from each shoot;
Yet the Birch on each bough, on the top of each switch, 
Bears the essence of grammar, the 8 parts of speech 
Amongst the leaves in concealed, more than mem'ry can mention
All cases, all genders, all forms of declension.
Nine branches when cropt by the hands of the nine,
Each duly arranged in a parallel line, 
Tied up in nine folds of a mystical string.
And soak'd for nine hours in cold Helicon's spring,
Is a sceptre compos'd for a Pedagogue's hand
Like the [Frafces] of Rome, a true badge of command.
The sceptre thus finished, like Moses's rod
From flints can draw years, and give life to a clod.

Where lurks the rich metal - the gold of the brain. 
Should Genius a captive by Sloth be confined
Or the witchcraft of pleasure prevail o'er the mind
Apply but their magical wand - with a stroke
The spell is dissolved, the enchantmit is broke,
Like Hermes's rod, these few switches inspires
Rhetorical thunder and Poetrys' fires.
And if morpheus our temples in Lethe should steep,
These switches untie all the fetter of sleep.
Here dwells strong conviction, of Logic the glory
When [his] us'd with precision or posterior
It promotes circulation, and thrills thro each vein
The faculty quickens, and purges the brain. 
Whatever disorders prevail in the blood
The birch can correct them like guiacum wood.
So luscious the juice is, so weet are its twigs
That at Sheffield they call them the Walkey-bank figs.
As the fam'd rod of Circe to brutes could change men
To the twigs of the birch can unbrute them again
