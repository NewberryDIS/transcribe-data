To lift a heele gainst truth, or thee dispise
Ffixe my right ffoot w[i]th fortitude gainst feare
Rivitt my left w[i]th ['fortitude' struck through] constancie to beare 
And that thy sharpe hoves may my sinnes apall 
Reach on thy hissope reed, thy purging Gall,
W[i]th maye distaste in mee ffleshlye delights
And to the spirritts food give apetite 
But father, lett this cupp the world, gilt cupp 
Passe by and yt I nere maye drincke that upp 
Lett me p[er]ceave this world soe loved of all [in margin Spongia]
Is but a Sponge, of viniger and gall
W[hi]ch when I tast, w[i]th consumatum est
Ile dye to it to live in thee at rest
And that (even Dead) like thee I maye appeare 
My hard hart through my left syde peirce &amp; teare
W[hi]ch thy spirituall lance, thy saving word
Whose pointe is sharper far, then speare or sword
Whence two fold streames of charitye may flowe
Blood when thou calst, water for theise bestow
Soe shall my foes yt gazeing on have stood [in margin Suffragum]
Say after death sure God to him was good
[in margin Sepultura] (1) When thus thy passion daye I passed have, [in margin (1) dies primus est affectionis et penitentia]
Laye mee to rest w[hi]ch in thy quiet grave
Was thy blood price purchas ye potters feild
To bury strangers, soe this earth maye yeild 
Some rest to us poore pilgrims till wee rise
But tis because thy blood hath paid the price,
Thus dead to sinne, O give my soule the honnor
(Manger the busy watch the worlde sitts on her
Meekelye to sleepe by thee, in safetye sure,
wrapt in thy righteousnes, thy syndon pure
[in margin Sign[um]] (2) Then seale my hart up, that it soe may staye [in margin (2) dies secundus est tranquilitatus et gra:]
In quiett by thy grace this second daye 
[in margin Resurectio] (3) Till on the third, in glorye I may rise
And see my blessed patterne w[hi]ch these eyes [in margin (3) dies tertius est praemiaconis et Gloria]
My God w[hi]ch hast for me thy losse not spared
My Jesus my exceeding great reward
faine would my soule breake through these prison lockes
(Lord, open to her, ffor shee stands &amp; knockes)
But when to raise hir up thy selfe knows be so
And therefore I submitt w[i]th this request
That when thy passion daye I first have kept
(And for my sinnes, w[hi]ch penitence have wept)
Untill the third daye raise me to thy glory
In peace this second I may end my storye.

passionate meditation
~
O man looke what paine for thee
willinglye I tooke on mee
see my body scourged round
that it seemes but all one wound
Hanging up twixt Earth and skie
mockt and scornd by all goes by
see my armes stretcht wide and open
and my sinewes torne and broken
while sharpe nayles with bitte pang
rend my pale hands where I hange
which myne owne waight doth not teare
But thy waighty sinne I beare
See my head (ay me forlorne)
peirced deepe with cruell thorne
which soe long thereon hath stoode
that each twig runns downe with blood
Viewe my feete and see my syde
Peircd and plowd by furrowes wyde
See all comfort from mee taken
Both of heaven and Earth forsaken
And not one with word or deede
Pittyes me while heare I bleede
yea all they that stand in hearinge
mocks me for my patient bearinge
and with scofs augment my sors
when for bitter paine I rore

    Ely, Ely, I an dyinge

Harke they mock mee to for cryinge
This I bear for thine amisse
was there ever pain like this!
Yes, and I doe most feare that
Least thou man should prove ingrate

    Now, thou dost but make me smarte,
    But in that thou kilst my heart.

The world's a Bubble, and the life of man lesse then a span
In his conception wretched, from the wombe soe to the tomb,
Nurst from the cradle, and brought up to yeares with cares &amp; feares,
whoe then to frayle mortallity shall trust
but limes the waters, or but writes in dust
yet whilst with sorrowe here, wee live opprest what life is best
courtes are but onely superficiall scooles to dandle fooles
the rurall partes are turn'de into a den of savage men
and wheres a citye, from foule vice soe free

Domesticke cares afflictes the Husbands bead or paynes his head
These that live single, takes it for a curse or doe thinges worse
They would have children, those that have the none or wish them gone
what is it then to have, or have noe wife
but single thraldome, or a duble striffe
our owne affections still at home to pleasse is a disseasse
