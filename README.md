## Status of the data
The data files in this repository are current as of the date given on the directory. The transcriptions have not been verified for accuracy or completion.

Transcription and translation data have been cleaned of markup, but some user-added annotations remain. Note that CSV files are encoded in UTF-8 so some characters may display strangely when viewed in Microsoft Excel.

Data will be updated semi-regularly, as time allows and possibly upon request, up until the point that transcriptions are considered "complete".
