  1) The name of the item
  2) The link to the transcription page for the item
  3) The transcription that was in place for the item as of the date given
  4) If applicable, the translation of the transcription text

Transcription and translation data has been cleaned of markup, but some user-added annotations remain.

Data will be updated semi-regularly, as time allows and possibly upon request, up until the point that transcriptions are considered "complete".
