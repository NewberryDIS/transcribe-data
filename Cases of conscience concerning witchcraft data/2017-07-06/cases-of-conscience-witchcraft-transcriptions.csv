which is throwly to be Weighed, &amp; if it does
not infallibly prove the Crime against the 
person accused, it ought not to determine 
him guilty of it for So righteous men may 
be condemned unjustly. In case of Witchcraft
we know that the Divel [capital D written over lowercase d] is the immediate Agent 
in the mischief done, the Consent or Compact of 
the witch is the thing to be demonstrated.
Among many Arguments to Evince this that 
which is most under present debate, is that 
which refers to Something vulgarly called Spec-
tre evidence [Spectre evidence is underlined] and a certain sort of ordeal [ordeal is in a different script]
or try all by the Sight and Touch. The princi-
pal plea to Justife the Convictive evidence of [written over 'again'] 
those is fetched from the Consideration of the wis=[symbol similar to trinity knot below line]

which they Suppose would fail if such things
were permitted to befall an inocent person. 
but it is Certain that too resolute conclusi-
ons drawn from Hence, are bold usurpations 
upon Spotless Soveraignty [word is underlined], &amp; tho Somethings 
if Suffered to be common would subvert this 
Government &amp; disband yea ruine Humane 
Society; yet God doth sometime suffer such

Cases of conscience concerning witchcrafts,http://publications.newberry.org/transcribe/scripto/transcribe/42/22320,"The contents
The first case considered, whether Satan may not possibly 
appear in the shape of an innocent and pious, as well as of 
a nocent and wicked person, to afflict such as suffer by 
Diabolical molestations. The Affirmative proved by six 
arguments. Arg 1. From [crossed out word] Several Scriptures. p.1. to 11. 
Arg.2. Because it is possible for the devill in the shape of 
an innocent person to do other mischiefs. proved by many instances. p.11 to 15.
Arg.3. Because if Satan may not Represent an inocent person as afflicting others, it must be Either because hee wants will, or Power to do thus, or because the holy God will never Permit him to do it . None of wch may be affirmed. p.15. to 22.
Arg.4. It is certayn both from Scripture [2 crossed out words] History that magicians by their inchantments, &amp; hellishe conjurations, may cause a false Representation of persons &amp; things. p. 22 to 26.
Arg.5. From the concurring judgement of many learned &amp; judicious men. p.26 to 29.
Arg 6. [or?][o^er] owne experience has confirmed ye truth of what wee affirm. 29.
The second case confirmed, viz. If one bewitched is struck down at ye Looke or call or the ey of another, &amp; after yt recovered again by a touch from ye same person, whether this is not an infallible proof that ye party suspected, &amp; complained of is in league wth the Devill? Ans. This may be ground of suspicion &amp; examination, but not of conviction. p. 30. 
The Judgement of Mr Barnard [underlined] &amp; Doctor [Coffa? underlined] [Cotter? underlined] produced. 
p. 31, 32. Several things offered against the infallible, Gility of this proof. 1 - It is possible &amp; probable yt ye Persons in Question may be posessed wth Lying Spirits G. V. 33, 3[number scratched out]
2. Falling down wth ye case of ye ey proceede not from a natural but an Arbitrary cause .p. 35.
3. That of the bewitched persons being recovered with a Touch is various &amp; fallible .p.36, 37.

5.The testimony of bewitched or possessed persons, is no
legal evidence as to what they [see?] concerning others, so 
[persons?] not as to themselves. p.41
6.Nothing can be produced out of ye word of God to 
shew that this is any proof of witchcraft. p.42
The Third case considered, viz. whether these are
any discoveries of witchcraft w^ch jurors and judges may 
with a safe conscience proceed upon to ye conviction &amp; 
condemnation of persons under suspicion. 
Two things premised. 1. That ye Evidence in this crime [word crossed out] 
of Witchcraft ought to be as clear as in any other crimes [word crossed out] 
of a capital nature. p. 43.
2. That there have bin wayes of Trying witches long used 
wch God never approved of, particularly yt of casting the
suspected party into ye water to try whether they would sink 
or swim. The vanity and great sin wch is [word crossed out] in that way 
of purgation evinced by six reasons. p. 45 to 48.
That yr are proofs for ye conviction of witches which 
jurors may wth a safe conscience proceed upon, proved 
from scripture p. 48, 49.
that a free &amp; voluntary confession is a sufficient 
ground of conviction. p. 49.
That the Testimony of confessing witches against others 
is not so clear an evidence as against themselves. p. 51.
That if two credible persons shall affirm upon oath 
that they have seen ye party accused, doing such things 
wch none but such as have Familiarity wth ye Devill, 
ever did or can do, that's a sufficient ground of 
conviction, &amp; yt this has often hapned. p 53.

As for Mr Sinclares notion that some persons may have a Second
Sight (as tis termed) &amp; yet be themselves Innocent, I am Satisfied
that he judgeth Right.  For this is common among the Laplanders
w^o  are horribly addicted to Magicall incantations.  They bequeath
their Demons to their children as a Legacy, by whom they are often
assisted (like bewitched persons as they are) to see &amp; do things beyond
the power of nature.  An Historian w^o[who] deserve credit Relates (p)   that a certain Laplander gave him a true &amp; particular account
of w^t had hapned to him in his journey to Lapland.  And further
complained to him w^th tears, that things at a great distance are
represented to him &amp; how much he desired to be delivered from
that diabolicall sight, but could not.  This doubtless w^s[was] caused by
Some Inchantment. but to proceed to what I intended, the
Eyes of persons by means of inchanting charms may not only See
what others do not, but be undr Such a power of fascination as that
things which are not shall really appear.  The apostle Speaks of
bewitched eyes Gal. 3.1 &amp; we know from Scripture that the
Imaginations of men have by inchantments ben imposed upon.
And Historians abound with very Strange instances of this nature
The old witch Circe by an inchanted cup caused Ulysses his compa
nions to imagine themselves to be turned into Swine.  &amp; how ma
ny witches have ben So bewitched by the Devil as Really to beleiv
that they were transform'd into wolvs or dogs or cats?  It is 
Reported of Simon Magus (q) that by his Sorceries he would
So impose on the Imaginations of people, as that they thought
he had really changd himself into another Sort of creature
Apollonius of Tyana could outdoe Simon with his Magick.
The great Bohemian Conjurer Zyto (r) by his inchantments cau-
sed certain persons whom he had a mind to try by his art upon to Ima-
gine that their hands were turned into the feet of an Ox, or into the
hoofs of an horse, So that they could not reach to ye dishes before them
to take any thing thence.  He Sold wisps of Straw to a butcher

If a Ma-gician by an inchanted glass can do this, they may as well by the help of a Demon cause false Ideas of persons &amp; things to be impressed on the Imaginations of bewitched persons. The blood &amp; Spirits of a man that is bitten with a mad dog, are so invenomed as that strange Impressions are thereby made on his Imagination. Let him be brought into a Room where there is a looking glass, &amp; he will (if put upon it) not only say but sweare that he sees a dog, tho^ in truth there is no dogg it may be within 20 miles of him.

made use of, whereupon the magistrates of the place ordered y^t
he should make his experiment with some other pin as they

w^ch was a sufficient discovery of the knavery &amp; witchery of the

Devil attending things inchanted we have confirmed by a pro-
digious instance in Major [underlined: Weir] a Scotchman. That wretched 
man was a perfect prodigy. A man of great parts, esteemed, a 
Saint, yet lived in Secret uncleaness with his own Sister for 
34 yeares together. After his wickedness was discovered he did 
not seem to be troubled at any of his crimes, excepting that
he had caused a poor woman to be publickly whipped because
She reported that she had seen him committing bestiality.
w^ch thing was true only the woman could not prove it. This
wretched creature, if he had his [underlined: inchanted staff] in his hand 
could pray to Admiration &amp; do extraordinary things as is more
amply Related in the postscript to mr [underlined: [underlined: Sinclare's] book before-
mentioned, but if he had not his enchanted Rod to lean 
upon he could not transform himself into an Angel of light.
But by all these things we conclude that it is not impossible
but that a guilty Conjurer that so he may render himself the
less Suspected may by his magical art &amp; enchantments cause
Innocent persons to be Represented as afflicting those, whome
the Devil &amp; himself are the Tormenters of.
Argum: 5. The truth we affirm is so evident as that many
learned &amp; Judicious men have freely subscribed unto it.
That memorable relation of the Devils assuming the Shape
of an Innocent citizen in [underlined: Zurick] is in the judgment of 
that great Divine [underlined Lud. Lavator] of weighty consideration.

Nor may we make use of a white Healing
witch (as they call them) to find out a black and a bloo-
dy one. &amp; how did men come to know that witches
would be discovered in Such wayes as those which

is of validity as to what they see done to themselves
then it is so as to Others whom they see afflicted no

had they this Supernaturall Sight? It must needs
be either from Heaven or from Hell. If from Hea-

have their Knowledge from Hell tho possibly ther may
be truth in what they affirm, they are not Loyall

That way of discovering witches by tying their hands
&amp; feet &amp; casting them on ye water to try whether
they will Sinke or Swim; I did publiquely bare my
Testimony against this Superstition in a Booke printed
at Boston Eight yeares Past. I heare of Late some
amongst us have bin playing with this diaboliall Inven-
tion. It is to be Lamented, that in such a Land of uprightnesse
as New-England once was, a practce which Protestant Writers
generally Condemn as Sinfull, &amp; which ye more Sober and
Learnedmen amongst Papists themselves have not only
judged unlawfull, but (to Expresse it in their owne Termes)
to be no lesse than a Mortall Sin, Should be Ever heard of
Were it not that ye Coming of Christ to judge
the Earth Draweth neer, I should think if such practices
are an unhappy Omen, if ye Devill &amp; Pagans will get these
Darke Territories into their Possession againe. But if
I may not be thought to have no Reason for my Calling ye
Impleaded Experiement into Question, I have these things
further to alledge against it. 1st. It has bin rejected Long

In Italy &amp; in Spain it is wholly Dissusd ^(a) &amp; in ye Low Countryes &amp; in

other Countries Neverthelesse, all ye ^(b) Academies throughout Germa
ny have disapproved of this way of Purgation.
2ly. The Devill is in it. All Superstition is for him. And where
^secret things or Latent Crimes are discovered by Super-
stitious practices, Some Compact &amp; Comunio with ye Devill
is ye Cause of it,  as Austin ^(c) hath truly Intimated. ffor if a Witch

bodyes, when hands &amp; feet are tyed, not to Sinke under ye
water. Besides, they yt plead for this Superstition, Say, yt if Witches
happen to be Condemned for Some other Crime &amp; not for witchcraft,
they will not Swim Like a Corke above water, which Sheweth
that ye Cause of this Natation is not Physical And if not
then Either it must proceed from a divine miracle, but no
man can thinke yt Heaven will worke a miracle to Save
a Witche from drowneing, or Lastly it must be a Diabolicall
wonder. This Superstitious Experiment is Comonly knowne by
the Natmes of ye Vulgar Probation, because it was never
appointed by any Lawful Authority, but by ye Suggestion of the
Devill taken up by ye rude Rabble. And Some (e) Learned Men
are of Opinion, yt ye first Explorator ^being a white witch did Explicitly Covenant w^th
ye Devill that he should discover Latent Crimes in this way.
And yt is i by vertue of yt first Contract yt ye Devill goeth to
works to keep his servants fro Sinkeing. W^n ye Ceremony of his
ordaining is used. Moreover, we know, ye Diaboliss est Deisimia, ye Devill
seeks to imitate divine miracles. We read in Ecclesiastical History, yt
some of ye Martyrs, w^n they were by their Persecutors ordered to be
drowned proved imersible. This miracle would ye Devill imitate
in causeing witches who are his Martyrs not to Sinke, w^n they are
cast into ye water. 3. This way of Purgation is of ye same Nature
w^th ye old Ordeals of ye Pagans. If men were accused w^th any Crime,
to cleare their Innocency they were to take a hot iron into their hands
or to Suffer Scalding water to be poured downe their throats, &amp; if they
received no hurt thereby, They were acquitted. This was ye Devills In-
vention, &amp; many times (as ye Devill would have it) they yt Sub-
mitted to these Tryalls Suffered no Inconvience. Neverthelesse
it is astonishing to thinke [] Innocent blood hath bin shed
in ye world by this Satanicall device Witches have
often (as (e) Sprenger observes) desird yt they might stand of fall by
this Tryall of hot Iron &amp; have somtimes Come of well. Inderd this
Ordeal was used in other Cases &amp; not in Cases of witchcraft

into ye water practised upon persons accused [insert: (f)] with other 
crimes as well as yt of witchcraft. How it came to be
now restrained to yt of witchcraft. I can not tell. it is as
Supernatural for a body whose hands &amp; feet are tyed to Swim
above ye water, as it is for their hands not to feel a red hot Iron.
If ye one of these ordeals is lawfull to be used, so is ye other too. 
But as for ye fiery ordeal it is rejected &amp; Exploded out of ye world.
For ye same reason yn this Tryall by water should be So.
4. It is a tempting of God, wn men put ye innocency of their
Fellow creatures upon such tryals. To desire ye Almighty to shew
a miracle to clear ye innocent, or to convict ye guilty is a
presumptuous tempting of him. Was it not a miracle when 
Peter was kept from Sinking under ye water by ye Om=
nipotency of Christ. As for Satan, wee know yt his Ambition
is to make his Servants believe, that his Power is equal to God's
&amp; yt therfore Hee can preserve wn he pleaseth.  I have read
of (g) certain Magicians who were seen walking on ye
water.  If yn Guilty persons shall float on ye waters,
Either it is ye Devil that causeth them So to do (as no Doubt it is)
And wt have men to do to set ye Devill on worke. or else it is a 
divine miracle Like yt of Peter's not Sinkeing, or yt of the Iron yt
swam at ye word of Elisha.  And shall men try whether God wil worke
a miracle to make a discovery? If a crime can not be found out 
but by Miracles, it is not for any Judge on Earth to Usurp the
Judgement which is reserved the Divine Throne.  5th This Pre-
tended gift of Immersibility attending Witches is a most
fallible deceitfull thing; for many a Witch hath Sanke
under the water.  Godelmannus (h) giveth an account of six Notorious
&amp; cleerly convicted witches; yt wn they were brought to this [underscored:Vulgar
Probation] sanke under ye water like other persons.
[underscored: Althusius] affirmes ye like concerning others. In ye Bohemian
History it is related yt [underscored: Vratislaus] the King of [underscored: Bohemia] Extirpated
witches out of his Kingdom, som of which were delivered
to ye Ax, others of them to ye fire, and others of
them he caused to be drowned.  If witches are

imersible, how came they to dy by drowneing in _Bohemia_? besides
it hath been knowne yt persons who have floated on ye water, wn the
hangman has made ye Experiment on ym have sunk downe like a stone wn
others have made ye Tryall. The Reasons Comonly alledged for ye superstition
are of no moment. It is said they hate ye water, wn as they have many
times desird yt they might be cast on ye water in order to their Purgation.
It is alledged yt water is used in Baptisme, therfore Witches Swim; A
weake phansy. All ye water in ye world is not Consecrated water.
But (say some) ye Devills by sucking of them makes ym so light yt ye
water bares them. Whereas some witches are twice as heavy as many
an innocent pson. Wel, but yn they are possest by ye Devill, suppose
so, Is ye Devill afraid if they sinke, he should be drownd wth them,
but why yn were ye Gaderens hogs drowned, wn ye Devill was in them.
These things being premised, I Answer ye Question Affirmatively
_There are proofs for ye Conviction of Witches, wch jurors may
wth a safe Conscience proceed upon so as to bring them inGuilty_
The scripture wch saith, _Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to Live_
clearly implyes yt some in ye world may be knowne and
proved to be witches. For untill they be so they may &amp; must
be suffered to Live. Moreover, wee find in ye Scripture, yt
some have bin convicted &amp; Executed for Witches. For _Saul
cut of those yt had familiar spirits &amp; ye Wizards out of ye Land._
[Sam. 28:9] It may be wondered at, yt Saul who did like
him yt said, _Flectere Si nequeo Superos, Acheronta Movebo_,
should cause ye wizzards in ye Land to be put to death
The Jewish Rabbies say, ye Reason was because those Wizzards fortold
if David should be King. It is (as Mr _Gaul_ (k) observes) ye opinion of
some Learned Protestants yt Saul in his zeal did overdo; And
yt under ye (L) Pretext of Witches he slew ye Gibeonites, for wch

mitting a Rape, or ye like Nefandous wickedness, if he

to condemn him. The Scripture approveth of judging the

yt she had covenanted wth ye Devill, &amp; was becom his Servant about
twenty yeares before, &amp; yt he kissed her &amp; gave her a Name, but
yt since he had never owned her.  Severall Ministers who were jealous
yt she had accused herselfe untruely, charged it on her Conscience, telling
her yt they doubted she was under a Temptation of ye Devill to destroy her
owne body &amp; soul, &amp; adjuring her in ye Name of God to declare ye Truth.

This her lamentable speech did astonish all ye spectators, few of
whom could refrain from Teares. The Truth of ys Relation (saith
my Author) (n) is certainely asserted by a worthy Divine now Living 
who was an Eye &amp; Ear wittness of ye whole matter. But thus did that
miserable creature suffer death. And this was a just Execution.
When the Amalekite confessed he had killed Saul whom [scratched out: he]

of Confessing witches against others, ye case is not so clean
as against themselves.  They are not such Credible wittnesses as
in a case of Life or Death is to Be desired.  It is beyond dispute yt
the Devill makes his Witches to dream strange things of themselves
&amp; others wch are not so.  There was (as Authors beyond Exception

Being Wolves. In a [crossed out] word, there is no more reallity in 
what many witches Confessed of Strange things Seen 
&amp; don by them, whilst Satan had them in his full 
power; than there is in Lucians [underlined] ridiculous Fables of his 
being bewitched into an Ass, &amp; with strange foals he then 
played. So that what such persons relate concerning persons 
&amp; things at Witch-meetings ought not to be received 
with too much Credulitie. I could mention dismal 
Instances of Innocent Blood which hath bin shed by meanes 
of the Lyes of some Confessing Witches. I shall only take 
notice of an awfull Example mentioned by H.B Spotswood [underlined] 
in his History of Scotland p. 449. His words are these. ""This 
Summer (vizt Anno 1597) There was a great buissness 
for the Tryall of Witches; amongst others one Mar-
-garet Atkin [underlined] being apprehended on suspicion, &amp; thretned 
with torture did confesse her selfe guilty. Being Ex-
amined touching her Assosciats in that Trade, she named 
a few, &amp; perceiving her delations find credit, made offer 
to detect all of that sort, &amp; to purge the Country of them, 
so she might have her Life graunted. For the

cret marke all of that sort in their eyes, whereby she could 
surely tell how soon she looked upon any whether they 
were witches or not. And in this she was so redily believed
that for the space of 3 or 4 months she was carried from Towne
to Towne to make discoveries in that kind. many were
brought in Question by her delations, especially at Glasgoe
where diverse innocent women, through the credulity of the Mi-
nister Mr John Cowper were Condemned and put to Death.
In the End she was found to be a meer deceiver and sent back
to Fife where she was first apprehended. At her Tryall she
affirmed all to be false and she had Confessed of her self or
others and persisted in this to her Death, which made many
forethinke -- their too great forwardness that way and mooved
the King to recall his Commissions given out against such
persons discharging all proceedings against it, Except 
in case of Voluntary Confession [Text in Left Margin: till a solid order should be taken by the estates touching the form that should be kept in their Trial.] Thus that ffamous Historian

ground for Conviction. Some are ready to say that Wisards are [illegible]
so unwise as to do Such things in the Sight or Hearing of others
but it is certayn that they have verry often bin known to do so. How
often have they bin seen by others useing Inchauntments? Co[n-]

Charmes, and to shew in a Glasse persons absent, And to reveal
